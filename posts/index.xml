      <description>Just a quick glance at Rust-lang, haven’t really done things with it. But I’m interested in its memory management system, so called “ownership”, and no “null” design.
Rust, borned in 2006, was firstly a personal project but then sponsored by Mozilla since 2009. It’s a compiled language and is known for its compilation time check.
There are two popular approaches of memory managements in modern programming languages. The first one is you, the developer, explicit allocate and deallocate them.</description>

      <description>RailsConf 2019, as a technical conference, there is a bunch of presentations about the fundamentals, deep inside the Rails framework, leveling up the skills. Rather than deep diving into those talks I attended, I would like to share more about DHH and other speakers’ thoughts about the Rails community, the connections within it and the bonds with the world.
Self-Actualization to Transcendence It’s often to hear a lot of announcements in a tech conference opening keynote, but not in this one.</description>
